My name is Ahmed Samir, and I am a third year at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence. I specialize in AI, but beyond that, I am generally interested in STEM fields.

I am a researcher at the Scientific Research School of Egypt, supervised by [Prof. Aboul Ella Hassanien](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aZ6bcngAAAAJ&hl=en), where I am working on developing machine learning algorithms.
